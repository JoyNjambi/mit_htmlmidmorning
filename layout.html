<H1>KENYAN LEVELS OF EDUCATION</H1>
<p>The current kenyan education system is 8-4-4,
meaning that a student has to go through 8 years of primary
school studies, then four of high school and finally four years
at the university..........this is ofcourse after pertaking in the
less vigorous basic nursery school system that seeks to ensure that a
learner knows how to read and write.</p>
